Description  : ParaView is an open-source, multi-platform data analysis and
             : visualization application. ParaView users can quickly build
             : visualizations to analyze their data using qualitative and
             : quantitative techniques. The data exploration can be done
             : interactively in 3D or programmatically using ParaViewâ€™s batch
             : processing capabilities. ParaView was developed to analyze extremely
             : large datasets using distributed memory computing resources. It can be
             : run on supercomputers to analyze datasets of petascale as well as on
             : laptops for smaller data. ParaView is an application framework as well
             : as a turn-key application.
             : The ParaView code base is designed in such a way that all of its
             : components can be reused to quickly develop vertical
             : applications. This flexibility allows ParaView developers to quickly
             : develop applications that have specific functionality for a specific
             : problem domain. ParaView runs on distributed and shared memory
             : parallel and single processor systems.
