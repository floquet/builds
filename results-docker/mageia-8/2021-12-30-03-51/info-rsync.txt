Summary      : A program for synchronizing files over a network
URL          : http://rsync.samba.org/
License      : GPLv3+
Description  : Rsync uses a quick and reliable algorithm to very quickly bring
             : remote and host files into sync.  Rsync is fast because it just
             : sends the differences in the files over the network (instead of
             : sending the complete files). Rsync is often used as a very powerful
             : mirroring process or just as a more capable replacement for the
             : rcp command.  A technical report which describes the rsync algorithm
             : is included in this package.
             : 
             : Install rsync if you need a powerful mirroring program.
             : 
             : This rpm has these patches applied from rsync tree:
             :   - acl: allow to mirror acl
             : 
             : Rebuild the source rpm with `--without patches' if you don't  want these patches
