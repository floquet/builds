Summary      : High-level language for numerical computations

License      : GPLv3+
Description  : GNU Octave is a high-level language, primarily intended for numerical
             : computations. It provides a convenient command line interface for
             : solving linear and nonlinear problems numerically, and for performing
             : other numerical experiments using a language that is mostly compatible
             : with Matlab. It may also be used as a batch-oriented language.
             : 
             : Octave has extensive tools for solving common numerical linear algebra
             : problems, finding the roots of nonlinear equations, integrating
             : ordinary functions, manipulating polynomials, and integrating ordinary
             : differential and differential-algebraic equations. It is easily
             : extensible and customizable via user-defined functions written in
             : Octave's own language, or using dynamically loaded modules written in
             : C++, C, Fortran, or other languages.
