Summary      : Powerful, light-weight programming language

Description  : Lua is a programming language originally designed for extending applications,
             : but also frequently used as a general-purpose, stand-alone language. Lua
             : combines simple procedural syntax (similar to Pascal) with powerful data
             : description constructs based on associative arrays and extensible semantics.
             : Lua is dynamically typed, interpreted from bytecodes, and has automatic memory
             : management, making it ideal for configuration, scripting, and rapid
             : prototyping. Lua is implemented as a small library of C functions, written in
             : ANSI C, and compiles unmodified in all known platforms. The implementation
             : goals are simplicity, efficiency, portability, and low embedding cost.
