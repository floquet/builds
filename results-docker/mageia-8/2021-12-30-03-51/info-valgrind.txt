Description  : When a program is run under Valgrind's supervision, all reads and
             : writes of memory are checked, and calls to malloc/new/free/delete are
             : intercepted. As a result, Valgrind can detect problems such as:
             : 
             :     * Use of uninitialised memory
             :     * Reading/writing memory after it has been free'd
             :     * Reading/writing off the end of malloc'd blocks
             :     * Reading/writing inappropriate areas on the stack
             :     * Memory leaks -- where pointers to malloc'd blocks are lost forever
             :     * Passing of uninitialised and/or unaddressible memory to system calls
             :     * Mismatched use of malloc/new/new [] vs free/delete/delete []
