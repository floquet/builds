Description  : PETSc, pronounced PET-see (the S is silent), is a suite of data
             : structures and routines for the scalable (parallel) solution of
             : scientific applications modeled by partial differential equations. It
             : supports MPI, and GPUs through CUDA or OpenCL, as well as hybrid
             : MPI-GPU parallelism. PETSc (sometimes called PETSc/Tao) also contains
             : the Tao optimization software library.
