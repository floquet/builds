Description  : Doxygen is a documentation system for C, C++ and IDL. It can generate
             : an on-line class browser (in HTML) and/or an off-line reference manual
             : (in LaTeX) from a set of documented source files. There is also
             : support for generating man pages and for converting the generated
             : output into Postscript, hyperlinked PDF or compressed HTML. The
             : documentation is extracted directly from the sources.
             : 
             : Doxygen can also be configured to extract the code-structure from
             : undocumented source files. This can be very useful to quickly find
             : your way in large source distributions.
