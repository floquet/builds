Description  : The Visualization ToolKit (VTK) is an object oriented software system for 3D
             : computer graphics, image processing, and visualization. VTK includes a
             : textbook, a C++ class library, and several interpreted interface layers
             : including Tcl/Tk, Java, and Python. VTK supports a wide variety of
             : visualization algorithms including scalar, vector, tensor, texture, and
             : volumetric methods. It also supports advanced modeling techniques like
             : implicit modeling, polygon reduction, mesh smoothing, cutting, contouring,
             : and Delaunay triangulation.  Moreover, dozens of imaging algorithms have been
             : integrated into the system. This allows mixing 2D imaging / 3D graphics
             : algorithms and data.
