Description  : Julia is a high-level, high-performance dynamic programming language
             : for technical computing, with syntax that is familiar to users of
             : other technical computing environments. It provides a sophisticated
             : compiler, distributed parallel execution, numerical accuracy, and an
             : extensive mathematical function library. The library, largely written
             : in Julia itself, also integrates mature, best-of-breed C and Fortran
             : libraries for linear algebra, random number generation, signal processing,
             : and string processing.
             : 
             : This package only contains the essential parts of the Julia environment:
             : the julia executable and the standard library.
