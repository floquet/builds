Description : The Environment Modules package provides for the dynamic
            : modification of a user's environment via modulefiles.
            : 
            : Each modulefile contains the information needed to configure the
            : shell for an application. Once the Modules package is initialized,
            : the environment can be modified on a per-module basis using the
            : module command which interprets modulefiles. Typically modulefiles
            : instruct the module command to alter or set shell environment
            : variables such as PATH, MANPATH, etc. modulefiles may be shared by
            : many users on a system and users may have their own collection to
            : supplement or replace the shared modulefiles.
            : 
            : Modules can be loaded and unloaded dynamically and atomically, in
            : an clean fashion. All popular shells are supported, including
            : bash, ksh, zsh, sh, csh, tcsh, as well as some scripting languages
            : such as perl.
            : 
            : Modules are useful in managing different versions of applications.
            : Modules can also be bundled into metamodules that will load an
            : entire suite of different applications.
            : 
            : NOTE: You will need to get a new shell after installing this
            : package to have access to the module alias.
