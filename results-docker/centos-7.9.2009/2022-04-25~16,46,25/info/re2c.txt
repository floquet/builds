Summary     : Tool for generating C-based recognizers from regular expressions

Description : re2c is a tool for writing very fast and very flexible scanners.
            : Unlike any other such tool, re2c focuses on generating high
            : efficient code for regular expression matching. As a result this
            : allows a much broader range of use than any traditional lexer
            : offers. And Last but not least re2c generates warning free code
            : that is equal to hand-written code in terms of size, speed and
            : quality.
