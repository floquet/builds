Description : HDF5 is a general purpose library and file format for storing
            : scientific data. HDF5 can store two primary objects: datasets and
            : groups. A dataset is essentially a multidimensional array of data
            : elements, and a group is a structure for organizing objects in an
            : HDF5 file. Using these two basic objects, one can create and store
            : almost any kind of scientific data structure, such as images,
            : arrays of vectors, and structured and unstructured grids. You can
            : also mix and match them in HDF5 files according to your needs.
