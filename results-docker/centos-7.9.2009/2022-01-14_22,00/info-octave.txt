Summary     : A high-level language for numerical computations
URL         : http://www.octave.org
License     : GPLv3+
Description : GNU Octave is a high-level language, primarily intended for
            : numerical computations. It provides a convenient command line
            : interface for solving linear and nonlinear problems numerically,
            : and for performing other numerical experiments using a language
            : that is mostly compatible with Matlab. It may also be used as a
            : batch-oriented language. Octave has extensive tools for solving
            : common numerical linear algebra problems, finding the roots of
            : nonlinear equations, integrating ordinary functions, manipulating
            : polynomials, and integrating ordinary differential and
            : differential-algebraic equations. It is easily extensible and
            : customizable via user-defined functions written in Octave's own
            : language, or using dynamically loaded modules written in C++, C,
            : Fortran, or other languages.
