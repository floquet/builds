Description : Boost provides free peer-reviewed portable C++ source libraries.
            : The emphasis is on libraries which work well with the C++ Standard
            : Library, in the hopes of establishing "existing practice" for
            : extensions and providing reference implementations so that the
            : Boost libraries are suitable for eventual standardization. (Some
            : of the libraries have already been included in the C++ 2011
            : standard and others have been proposed to the C++ Standards
            : Committee for inclusion in future standards.)
