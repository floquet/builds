Summary     : Debug version of the Python runtime

Description : python3-debug provides a version of the Python runtime with
            : numerous debugging features enabled, aimed at advanced Python
            : users such as developers of Python extension modules.
            : 
            : This version uses more memory and will be slower than the regular
            : Python build, but is useful for tracking down reference-counting
            : issues and other bugs.
            : 
            : The bytecode format is unchanged, so that .pyc files are
            : compatible between this and the standard version of Python, but
            : the debugging features mean that C/C++ extension modules are
            : ABI-incompatible and must be built for each version separately.
            : 
            : The debug build shares installation directories with the standard
            : Python runtime, so that .py and .pyc files can be shared.
            : Compiled extension modules use a special ABI flag ("d") in the
            : filename, so extensions for both versions can co-exist in the same
            : directory.
