Description : Lua is a powerful light-weight programming language designed for
            : extending applications. Lua is also frequently used as a
            : general-purpose, stand-alone language. Lua is free software.
            : Lua combines simple procedural syntax with powerful data
            : description constructs based on associative arrays and extensible
            : semantics. Lua is dynamically typed, interpreted from bytecodes,
            : and has automatic memory management with garbage collection,
            : making it ideal for configuration, scripting, and rapid
            : prototyping.
