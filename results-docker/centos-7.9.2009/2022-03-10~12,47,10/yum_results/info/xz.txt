Description : XZ Utils are an attempt to make LZMA compression easy to use on
            : free (as in freedom) operating systems. This is achieved by
            : providing tools and libraries which are similar to use than the
            : equivalents of the most popular existing compression algorithms.
            : 
            : LZMA is a general purpose compression algorithm designed by Igor
            : Pavlov as part of 7-Zip. It provides high compression ratio while
            : keeping the decompression speed fast.
