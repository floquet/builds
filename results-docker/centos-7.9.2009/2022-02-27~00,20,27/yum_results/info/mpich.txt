Summary      : A high-performance implementation of MPI
URL          : https://www.mpich.org/
License      : MIT
Description  : MPICH is a high-performance and widely portable implementation of the Message
             : Passing Interface (MPI) standard (MPI-1, MPI-2 and MPI-3). The goals of MPICH
             : are: (1) to provide an MPI implementation that efficiently supports different
             : computation and communication platforms including commodity clusters (desktop
             : systems, shared-memory systems, multicore architectures), high-speed networks
             : (10 Gigabit Ethernet, InfiniBand, Myrinet, Quadrics) and proprietary high-end
             : computing systems (Blue Gene, Cray) and (2) to enable cutting-edge research in
             : MPI through an easy-to-extend modular framework for other derived
             : implementations.
             : 
             : The mpich binaries in this RPM packages were configured to use the default
             : process manager (Hydra) using the default device (ch3). The ch3 device
             : was configured with support for the nemesis channel that allows for
             : shared-memory and TCP/IP sockets based communication.
             : 
             : This build also include support for using the 'module environment' to select
             : which MPI implementation to use when multiple implementations are installed.
             : If you want MPICH support to be automatically loaded, you need to install the
             : mpich-autoload package.
