Description  : XZ Utils are an attempt to make LZMA compression easy to use on free (as in
             : freedom) operating systems. This is achieved by providing tools and libraries
             : which are similar to use than the equivalents of the most popular existing
             : compression algorithms.

             : LZMA is a general purpose compression algorithm designed by Igor Pavlov as
             : part of 7-Zip. It provides high compression ratio while keeping the
             : decompression speed fast.
