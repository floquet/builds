Description : ParaView is an application designed with the need to visualize
            : large data sets in mind. The goals of the ParaView project include
            : the following:
            : 
            :     * Develop an open-source, multi-platform visualization
            :       application.
            :     * Support distributed computation models to process large data
            :       sets.
            :     * Create an open, flexible, and intuitive user interface.
            :     * Develop an extensible architecture based on open standards.
            : 
            : ParaView runs on distributed and shared memory parallel as well as
            : single processor systems and has been successfully tested on
            : Windows, Linux and various Unix workstations and clusters. Under
            : the hood, ParaView uses the Visualization Toolkit as the data
            : processing and rendering engine and has a user interface written
            : using a unique blend of Tcl/Tk and C++.
            : 
            : NOTE: The version in this package has NOT been compiled with MPI
            : support.
            : 
            : Install the paraview-openmpi package to get a version compiled
            : with openmpi.
            : 
            : 
            : Install the paraview-mpich package to get a version compiled with
            : mpich.
