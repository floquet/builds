Summary     : A program for synchronizing files over a network

Description : Rsync uses a reliable algorithm to bring remote and host files
            : into sync very quickly. Rsync is fast because it just sends the
            : differences in the files over the network instead of sending the
            : complete files. Rsync is often used as a very powerful mirroring
            : process or just as a more capable replacement for the rcp command.
            : A technical report which describes the rsync algorithm is included
            : in this package.
