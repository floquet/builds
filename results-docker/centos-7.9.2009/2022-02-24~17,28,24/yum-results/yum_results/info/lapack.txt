Description : LAPACK (Linear Algebra PACKage) is a standard library for
            : numerical linear algebra. LAPACK provides routines for solving
            : systems of simultaneous linear equations, least-squares solutions
            : of linear systems of equations, eigenvalue problems, and singular
            : value problems. Associated matrix factorizations (LU, Cholesky,
            : QR, SVD, Schur, and generalized Schur) and related computations
            : (i.e., reordering of Schur factorizations and estimating condition
            : numbers) are also included. LAPACK can handle dense and banded
            : matrices, but not general sparse matrices. Similar functionality
            : is provided for real and complex matrices in both single and
            : double precision. LAPACK is coded in Fortran90 and built with gcc.
