Description  : Lua is a powerful light-weight programming language designed for
             : extending applications. Lua is also frequently used as a
             : general-purpose, stand-alone language. Lua is free software.
             : Lua combines simple procedural syntax with powerful data description
             : constructs based on associative arrays and extensible semantics. Lua
             : is dynamically typed, interpreted from bytecodes, and has automatic
             : memory management with garbage collection, making it ideal for
             : configuration, scripting, and rapid prototyping.
