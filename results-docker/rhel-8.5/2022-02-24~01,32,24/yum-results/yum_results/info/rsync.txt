Summary      : A program for synchronizing files over a network
URL          : http://rsync.samba.org/
License      : GPLv3+
Description  : Rsync uses a reliable algorithm to bring remote and host files into
             : sync very quickly. Rsync is fast because it just sends the differences
             : in the files over the network instead of sending the complete
             : files. Rsync is often used as a very powerful mirroring process or
             : just as a more capable replacement for the rcp command. A technical
             : report which describes the rsync algorithm is included in this
             : package.
