Summary     : Allows restricted root access for specified users
URL         : http://www.courtesan.com/sudo/
License     : ISC
Description : Sudo (superuser do) allows a system administrator to give certain
            : users (or groups of users) the ability to run some (or all)
            : commands as root while logging all commands and arguments. Sudo
            : operates on a per-command basis.  It is not a replacement for the
            : shell.  Features include: the ability to restrict what commands a
            : user may run on a per-host basis, copious logging of each command
            : (providing a clear audit trail of who did what), a configurable
            : timeout of the sudo command, and the ability to use the same
            : configuration file (sudoers) on many different machines.
