Summary      : Numerical linear algebra package libraries

License      : BSD
Description  : LAPACK (Linear Algebra PACKage) is a standard library for numerical
             : linear algebra. LAPACK provides routines for solving systems of
             : simultaneous linear equations, least-squares solutions of linear
             : systems of equations, eigenvalue problems, and singular value
             : problems. Associated matrix factorizations (LU, Cholesky, QR, SVD,
             : Schur, and generalized Schur) and related computations (i.e.,
             : reordering of Schur factorizations and estimating condition numbers)
             : are also included. LAPACK can handle dense and banded matrices, but
             : not general sparse matrices. Similar functionality is provided for
             : real and complex matrices in both single and double precision. LAPACK
             : is coded in Fortran90 and built with gcc.
