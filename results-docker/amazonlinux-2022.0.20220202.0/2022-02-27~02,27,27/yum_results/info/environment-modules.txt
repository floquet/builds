Description  : The Environment Modules package provides for the dynamic modification of
             : a user's environment via modulefiles.
             : 
             : Each modulefile contains the information needed to configure the shell
             : for an application. Once the Modules package is initialized, the
             : environment can be modified on a per-module basis using the module
             : command which interprets modulefiles. Typically modulefiles instruct
             : the module command to alter or set shell environment variables such as
             : PATH, MANPATH, etc. modulefiles may be shared by many users on a system
             : and users may have their own collection to supplement or replace the
             : shared modulefiles.
             : 
             : Modules can be loaded and unloaded dynamically and atomically, in an
             : clean fashion. All popular shells are supported, including bash, ksh,
             : zsh, sh, csh, tcsh, as well as some scripting languages such as perl.
             : 
             : Modules are useful in managing different versions of applications.
             : Modules can also be bundled into metamodules that will load an entire
             : suite of different applications.
