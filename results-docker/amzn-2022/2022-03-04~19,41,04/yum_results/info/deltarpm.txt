Summary     : Create deltas between rpms
URL         : http://gitorious.org/deltarpm/deltarpm
License     : BSD
Description : A deltarpm contains the difference between an old
            : and a new version of a rpm, which makes it possible
            : to recreate the new rpm from the deltarpm and the old
            : one. You don't have to have a copy of the old rpm,
            : deltarpms can also work with installed rpms.
