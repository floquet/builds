Description : The patch program applies diff files to originals.  The diff
            : command is used to compare an original to a changed file.  Diff
            : lists the changes made to the file.  A person who has the original
            : file can then use the patch command with the diff file to add the
            : changes to their original file (patching the file).
            : 
            : Patch should be installed because it is a common way of upgrading
            : applications.
