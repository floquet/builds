Description : Valgrind is an instrumentation framework for building dynamic
            : analysis tools. There are Valgrind tools that can automatically
            : detect many memory management and threading bugs, and profile your
            : programs in detail. You can also use Valgrind to build new tools.
            : The Valgrind distribution currently includes six
            : production-quality tools: a memory error detector (memcheck, the
            : default tool), two thread error detectors (helgrind and drd), a
            : cache and branch-prediction profiler (cachegrind), a call-graph
            : generating cache and branch-prediction profiler (callgrind), and a
            : heap profiler (massif).
