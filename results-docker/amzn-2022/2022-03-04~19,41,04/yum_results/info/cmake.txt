Description : CMake is used to control the software compilation process using
            : simple platform and compiler independent configuration files.
            : CMake generates native makefiles and workspaces that can be used
            : in the compiler environment of your choice. CMake is quite
            : sophisticated: it is possible to support complex environments
            : requiring system configuration, preprocessor generation, code
            : generation, and template instantiation.
