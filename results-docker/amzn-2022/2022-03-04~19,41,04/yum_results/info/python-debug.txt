Summary     : Debug version of the Python runtime
URL         : http://www.python.org/
License     : Python
Description : python-debug provides a version of the Python runtime with
            : numerous debugging features enabled, aimed at advanced Python
            : users, such as developers of Python extension modules.
            : 
            : This version uses more memory and will be slower than the regular
            : Python build, but is useful for tracking down reference-counting
            : issues, and other bugs.
            : 
            : The bytecodes are unchanged, so that .pyc files are compatible
            : between the two version of Python, but the debugging features mean
            : that C/C++ extension modules are ABI-incompatible with those built
            : for the standard runtime.
            : 
            : It shares installation directories with the standard Python
            : runtime, so that .py and .pyc files can be shared.  All compiled
            : extension modules gain a "_d" suffix ("foo_d.so" rather than
            : "foo.so") so that each Python implementation can load its own
            : extensions.
