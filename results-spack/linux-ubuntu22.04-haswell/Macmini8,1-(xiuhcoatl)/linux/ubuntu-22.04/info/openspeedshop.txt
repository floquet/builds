CMakePackage:   openspeedshop

Description:
    OpenSpeedShop is a community effort led by Trenza, Inc. It builds on top
    of a broad list of community infrastructures, most notably Dyninst and
    MRNet from UW, libmonitor from Rice, and PAPI from UTK. OpenSpeedShop is
    an open source multi platform Linux performance tool which is targeted
    to support performance analysis of applications running on both single
    node and large scale IA64, IA32, EM64T, AMD64, PPC, ARM, Power8, Intel
    Phi, Blue Gene and Cray platforms. OpenSpeedShop development is hosted
    by Trenza Inc.. The infrastructure and base components of OpenSpeedShop
    are released as open source code primarily under LGPL.
