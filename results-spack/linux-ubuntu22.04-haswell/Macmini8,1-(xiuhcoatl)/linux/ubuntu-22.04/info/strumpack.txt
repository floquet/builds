CMakePackage:   strumpack

Description:
    STRUMPACK -- STRUctured Matrix PACKage - provides linear solvers for
    sparse matrices and for dense rank-structured matrices, i.e., matrices
    that exhibit some kind of low-rank property. It provides a distributed
    memory fully algebraic sparse solver and preconditioner. The
    preconditioner is mostly aimed at large sparse linear systems which
    result from the discretization of a partial differential equation, but
    is not limited to any particular type of problem. STRUMPACK also
    provides preconditioned GMRES and BiCGStab iterative solvers.
