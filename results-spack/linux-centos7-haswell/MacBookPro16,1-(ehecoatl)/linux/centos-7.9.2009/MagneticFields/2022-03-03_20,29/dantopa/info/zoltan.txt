AutotoolsPackage:   zoltan

Description:
    The Zoltan library is a toolkit of parallel combinatorial algorithms for
    parallel, unstructured, and/or adaptive scientific applications.
    Zoltan's largest component is a suite of dynamic load-balancing and
    partitioning algorithms that increase applications' parallel performance
    by reducing idle time. Zoltan also has graph coloring and graph ordering
    algorithms, which are useful in task schedulers and parallel
    preconditioners.
