  # Temporary locations Spack can try to use for builds.
  #
  # Recommended options are given below.
  #
  # Builds can be faster in temporary directories on some (e.g., HPC) systems.
  # Specifying `$tempdir` will ensure use of the default temporary directory
  # (i.e., ``$TMP` or ``$TMPDIR``).
  #
  # Another option that prevents conflicts and potential permission issues is
  # to specify `$user_cache_path/stage`, which ensures each user builds in their
  # home directory.
  #
  # A more traditional path uses the value of `$spack/var/spack/stage`, which
  # builds directly inside Spack's instance without staging them in a
  # temporary space.  Problems with specifying a path inside a Spack instance
  # are that it precludes its use as a system package and its ability to be
  # pip installable.
  #
  # In any case, if the username is not already in the path, Spack will append
  # the value of `$user` in an attempt to avoid potential conflicts between
  # users in shared temporary spaces.
  #
  # The build stage can be purged with `spack clean --stage` and
  # `spack clean -a`, so it is important that the specified directory uniquely
  # identifies Spack staging to avoid accidentally wiping out non-Spack work.
