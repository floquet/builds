\section*{Acknowledgements}

We would like to thank the following persons.
Ruth Klundt of Sandia National Laboratories who indicated to me
a technical article on the benchmark program IOR.
Alice Koniges of Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory who provided
information on MPI-IO on the GPFS filesystem.
Rob Latham of Argonne National Laboratory who provided technical
information on MPI-IO.
Rajeev Thakur of Argonne National Laboratory who indicated
resources of information.
Richard Hedges of the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory who
provided detailed information concerning the IOR benchmark program.
Hank Happ of Applied Research Associates who described the IO bottleneck
in a particular computer program that he develops.
Henry Newman of Instrumental Inc.\ who provided very extensive
information on parallel I/O and filesystems for HPC.

Help from vendors included the following.
Alan Minga of Cray indicated articles about work that
has been done by Cray on optimizing parallel MPI-IO, NetCDF and HDF5.
David Knaak of Cray provided technical comments on the
IOR benchmark results.
William Kneisly, Client Manager, IBM contacted others at
IBM to find details about parallel I/O on the GPFS filesystem.
Ellick Law of IBM indicated two articles on optimizing
MPI-IO for GPFS.
John Leidel, Systems Engineer, SGI explained the FFIO routines
and described SGI's efforts in the area of parallel I/O.

We would also like to thank the following.
Robert Alter at ERDC DSRC has been helpful in contacting program
developers that may need MPI-IO.
Robert Maier has contacted people that are involved in MPI-IO.
Thomas Cortese of PETTT has sought developers that might
benefit from improving parallel I/O.
Matthew Koop of PETTT described their expected involvement in
I/O performance due to the increasing gap between CPU and
storage speeds.
Justin La Barre at the Army Research Laboratory,
Robert Lunceford at the Navy DSCR and
Don Bahls at the Artic Region Supercomputer Center
have provided useful information about the
specific sites with which they are affiliated.
Other contacts include Lance Terada at MHPC,
Rick Roberts at AFRL and John Skinner at the Navy DSCR.
Thomas Oppe and Carrie Leach at ERDC have provided information
concerning their experiences in running benchmark programs
that use MPI-IO.

John West was initially involved in this special emphasis project.
During the execution of the planning stage, James Cliburn has been
the Lockheed-Martin lead and Robert Hunter has been the USACE, ERDC lead.
