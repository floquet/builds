Near bottom of page there is item called
NCL: NCAR Command Language

As of June 15, 2015, most recent is
NCL-NCARG-6.2.1 , created Sept. 2, 2014

At a minimum, you should have the following libraries (and
associated include files) installed on your system:
 X11, Xaw, Xext, Xm, Xmu, Xt.

After making a request, topaz now has

X11
   xorg-x11-libX11-devel
Xaw
   xorg-x11-devel
Xext
   xorg-x11-libXext-devel
Xm
   openmotif-devel
Xmu
   xorg-x11-libXmu-devel
Xt
   xorg-x11-libXt-devel

Because it provides libraries, compile for three compiler suites.
Compile for login nodes rather than compute nodes because
it is graphics.

cairo problem is that topaz has
cairo-1.8.8

All Makefile files have
LEXLIB          = -ll
when it should be
LEXLIB          = -lfl
See if changing the following solves the problem
/p/home/scheinin/build/ncarg-intel/src/ncarg/config/Template
Change from
#define LexLibrary      -ll
Change to
#define LexLibrary      -lfl
One of the few places where the problem occurs is the file
/p/home/scheinin/build/ncarg-intel/src/ncarg/ni/src/mkwrap/Makefile
Change from
LEXLIB          = -ll
Change to
LEXLIB          = -lfl
Note, the Makefile does not exist until "./Configure -v" and
after "make Everything" has run for awhile.

Note done for Intel, should be done in future

# This really should be LINUX.64.INTEL
# but just do the following.
mv LINUX LINUX_original
cp LINUX.64.INTEL LINUX

Before doing the copy
diff LINUX LINUX.64.INTEL

Significant differences are compiler and compiler options.
Also, below
< #define HdfDefines  -DLINUX
> #define HdfDefines  -DLINUX64
< #define XLibrary      -lX11 -lXext
> #define XLibrary -lXpm -lX11 -lXext

< #define ArchRecLibSearch    -L/usr/X11R6/lib64
> #define ArchRecLibSearch    -L/usr/X11R6/lib
Actually, both /usr/X11R6/lib and /usr/X11R6/lib64 are empty.

My note from past installs, the extra -lXpm in XLibrary is good.
Also good, define XToolLibrary -lXt -lSM -lICE .

Follow my notes from the past and

Have hdf4 because there is a compilation that looks for information

and
/p/home/apps/unsupported/hdf4/4.2.11-gcc49/include
have file netcdf.h .  It seems that putting hdf4 second in include search
paths will solve the problem.  Need definitions found in netcdf, not hdf4.
Have hdf4 because there is a compilation that looks for information
in there though I only expect to use hdf5.

Test the NCL and/or NCAR Graphics installation

export PATH=${PREFIX}/bin:$PATH
cd <some workspace>

You can quickly test if NCL is installed properly by typing "ncl" with the "-V" option to get the version, and then running a quick program:

    ncl -V
    ng4ex gsun01n

The ng4ex command will copy an NCL script called gsun01n.ncl into your current working directory, and run it with NCL. An X11 window should pop up with an XY plot drawn on it. Click on this plot with your left mouse button to keep advancing to the next frame.

Once this file is in your directory, you can also run it yourself with:

    ncl gsun01n.ncl

If "ncl" seems to be working, then this indicates that your build of NCAR Graphics was at least mostly successful, since NCL depends on the NCAR Graphics libraries.

To test NCAR Graphics only, there's an extensive suite of examples available. You should refer to the NCAR Graphics Fundamentals. It will show you how to run examples and test programs, and how to view the resulting graphics. Using the ncargex and ctrans programs is the easiest way to test the installation and become familiar with the use of NCAR Graphics.

For a quick test, try the following:

    ncargex cpex08
    ctrans -d X11 cpex08.ncgm

The first command will copy a file called cpex08.f into your current working directory, compile, link, and execute it, and create a graphics file called cpex08.ncgm. The second command will display the graphic on an X11 window on your screen. You must have your DISPLAY environment variable set correctly for this command to work. Left-click on the X11 window to make the graphic go away.
