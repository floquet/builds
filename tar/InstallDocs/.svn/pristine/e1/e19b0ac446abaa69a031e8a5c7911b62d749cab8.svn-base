# Save results of "configure" (not in config.log because that
# filename is used by configure) because the output described
# what has been enabled.

./configure --prefix=$PREFIX \
  --with-x  --x-includes=/usr/include/X11  --x-libraries=/usr/lib64 \
  2>&1 | tee config.out

Not the complete list of capabilities -- for the sake of brevity --
but a partial list of important capabilities is the following.
  
  Standalone terminals: yes (always builtin)
    canvas, cgm, context, corel, dumb, dxf, eepic, emf, emtex,
    epslatex, fig, gpic, hp2623a, hp2648, hpgl, imagen,
    latex, metafont, metapost, mif, pcl5, postscript, pslatex,
    pstex, pstricks, qms, regis, svg,
    tek40xx, tek410x, texdraw, tgif, tkcanvas, tpic, vttek

  X Window System terminal: yes
    (with multi-byte fonts)
    (enable plotting to windows opened by external apps) 
    (with application defaults, in /etc/X11/app-defaults/)
  jpeg terminal: no (requires libgd with jpeg support)
  gif terminal: no (requires libgd with gif support)
  png terminal: no (requires libgd with png support)
    (jpeg, gif and png terminals cannot use TTF fonts, requires libgd support)
  pdf terminal: no (requires libpdf)

make  2>&1 | tee make.log

# With X capability and X forwarding enabled,
# shows a large number of plots.
make check

find $PREFIX  # to check destination
make install
find $PREFIX  # to check result

Curiously, though end of configure says
" png terminal: no (requires libgd with png support) "
the command
 ldd /usr/local/usp/COST/gnuplot-4.6.5/bin/gnuplot
shows features such as
libpng12.so.0 => /usr/lib64/libpng12.so.0
libfreetype.so.6 => /usr/lib64/libfreetype.so.6
libexpat.so.1 => /lib64/libexpat.so.1

topdir=$PREFIX

cd $topdir
# Look carefully at actual working directory before doing the following.
chmod ugo+xr $topdir
find . -perm /u=x -exec chmod ugo+x {} \;
chmod -R ugo+r *
# Use g+w so that other members of the staff can modify.
chmod -R g+w,o-w *

# Done on Oct. 26, 2010 when not new software was being installed.

# Verify jpeg and png and gif and pfd in config.out are 'yes'
# For Jan. 2010 build the above feature were not built.
