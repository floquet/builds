On garnet06, installed parallel-netcdf-1.2.0 with a procedure analogous
to what is described below.

# "module list" includes
# xt-os/2.2.41A_PS05
# pgi/9.0.4
# xt-mpt/3.5.0
# xt-pe/2.2.41A_PS05

# Then environment variables are simple because on the Cray XT
# many compile and link flags are added automatically.

export CC=cc
export MPICC=$CC
export CPPFLAGS=""
export CFLAGS="-O2"
export F90=ftn
export FC=$F90
export MPIF77=$F90
export F77=$F90
export FPPFLAGS="-O2"
export CXX=CC
export CXXFLAGS="-O2"
export LIBS=""
export LDFLAGS=""

# On onyx where I have the C shell
setenv CC cc
setenv MPICC $CC
setenv CPPFLAGS ""
setenv CFLAGS "-O2"
setenv F90 ftn
setenv FC $F90
setenv MPIF77 $F90
setenv F77 $F90
setenv FPPFLAGS "-O2"
setenv CXX CC
setenv CXXFLAGS "-O2"
setenv LIBS ""
setenv LDFLAGS ""


# Prefix directory /usr/local/usp/netcdf/pnetcdf-1.1.0/
# bin  include  lib  man  src

cd /usr/local/usp/netcdf/pnetcdf-1.1.0/src/parallel-netcdf-1.1.0

./configure --prefix=/usr/local/usp/netcdf/pnetcdf-1.1.0

For pnetcdf-1.2.0
needed to change macros.make to have
F90		= ftn
because after configure F90 was set to blank.

parallel-netCDF features:
. parallel-netcdf configured WITH support for large files
. parallel-netcdf configured WITH fortran bindings
. parallel-netcdf configured WITH nonblocking routines
. parallel-netcdf configured WITH giant variable support

make

# Did not test running in parallel
# The testing procedure is crude, which reflects poorly on
# the code quality.  Nonetheless, it worked OK when used
# with WRF.

make install

cp pnetcdf.inc pnetcdf.mod
 /usr/local/usp/netcdf/pnetcdf-1.1.0/include/pnetcdf.inc
Error:
cp: target `/usr/local/usp/netcdf/pnetcdf-1.1.0/include/pnetcdf.inc' is not a directory
is part of the install and is an error.
Do "cd src/libf" then
cp pnetcdf.inc pnetcdf.mod /usr/local/usp/netcdf/pnetcdf-1.1.0/include/

to be sure everything was installed, in directories
src/lib  src/libf  src/utils
did "make install"

make clean
