Intel(R) Trace Analyzer and Collector for Linux* OS
Release Notes
----------------------------------------------------

--------
Overview
--------

The Intel(R) Trace Collector is a low-overhead tracing library that performs
event-based tracing in applications. You can analyze the collected trace data
for performance hotspots and bottlenecks. The product is completely thread safe
and integrates with C/C++, FORTRAN and multithreaded processes with and
without MPI. It supports binary instrumentation and fail-safe mode.
Additionally it can check for MPI programming and system errors.
The Intel(R) Trace Analyzer provides a convenient way to monitor application
activities gathered by the Intel Trace Collector through graphical displays.
You can view the desired level of detail, quickly identify performance hotspots
and bottlenecks, and analyze their causes. The Intel Trace Analyzer is
available on Linux* OS and Microsoft* Windows* XP OS .

Bundled together, the Intel(R) Trace Analyzer and Collector provide optimized
analysis and visualization capabilities. Together they offer fast graphical
rendering of complex profiling data and they easily scale up to hundreds of
processes.

Product Contents
----------------

This Product package contains the following components:

The Intel(R) Trace Analyzer and Collector for Linux*

Documentation for the Intel(R) Trace Analyzer and Collector can be found at
<installation_directory>/doc. The ITA_Reference_Guide.pdf includes a tutorial
introduction for the Intel Trace Analyzer and the ITC_Reference_Guide.pdf
documents the Intel Trace Collector.
The Intel Trace Analyzer comes with an online help system (html) while the
Intel Trace Collector provides man pages on Linux*.

NOTES: Adobe Acrobat Reader* or another pdf reader such as xpdf is required to
view the product documentation.

Third-party sources of the components of the Intel Trace Analyzer and Collector, for
example those released under GPL, may be downloaded
from ftp://ftp.ikn.intel.com/pub/opensource.


------------
Installation
------------

Linux Systems:

To install the Intel Trace Analyzer and Collector, execute 'install.sh'. You
will be prompted for an installation directory which defaults to
/opt/intel/itac/7.2.<package#>. You will also be asked to select components
from a list which you want to be installed and for which MPI implementation
the default paths should be set. It is recommended to use identical install
paths on all nodes, through appropriate mounting or creating multiple copies.
Please refer to the built-in help pages (--help) to get more information about
the installer.

After installation, read the documentation in '<installation_directory>/doc'.

Prior to using the Intel Trace Analyzer and Collector, you should source
<installation_directory>/bin/itacvars.[c]sh to set the appropriate environment
variables for smooth functioning of the software. Read the user guide for
details on how to switch between different MPI implementations.

To invoke the Intel(R) Trace Analyzer execute
'<installation_directory>/bin/traceanalyzer'.

Microsoft* Windows* Operating Systems:

To install the Intel(R) Trace Analyzer and Collector double-click the installer
file setup.exe and follow the instructions given during the installation. You
will be asked for the location of your license file and for components to be
installed. For your convenience the installer also offers you to register the
Trace Analyzer with trace files created by the Trace Collector (*.stf).

After installation, read
'<installation_directory>/doc/ITC_Reference_Guide.pdf' and
'<installation_directory>/doc/ITA_Reference_Guide.pdf'.

Prior to using the Intel Trace Collector, you should source
<installation_directory>/bin/itacvars.bat to set the appropriate environment
variables for smooth functioning of the software.

You can invoke Intel Trace Analyzer via its entry in the Start Menu, or by
double-clicking '<installation_directory>/bin/traceanalyzer.exe', or by
executing it from a command shell. If registered, double-clicking tracefiles
(*.stf) opens them with the Intel Trace Analyzer.

----------------------
Installing the license
----------------------

The Intel Trace Analyzer and Collector uses Macrovision Corporation FLEXlm*
electronic licensing technology. License management is transparent to the user.
During the installation you will be prompted for a valid license, which is
required to successfully complete the installation of the Intel Trace Analyzer
and Collector. On Linux* the provided scripts itacvars.sh or itacvars.csh will
ensure that the path of your license file is contained in the environment
variable INTEL_LICENSE_FILE.

Since the Intel(R) Trace Analyzer uses a time-limited license, the license file
must remain in place on the system.

-------------------------------------
Uninstalling the Intel Trace Analyzer
-------------------------------------

Linux* Systems:

To uninstall the Intel Trace Analyzer and Collector run the script
'<installation_directory>/uninstall.sh'. 

Microsoft* Windows* Operating Systems:

Uninstalling the Intel Trace Analyzer is done in the usual way via the
Start->Settings->Control Panel->Add or Remove Programs menu selection. Choose
the Intel Trace Analyzer and select Remove.

Note: Uninstalling the Intel Trace Analyzer will remove the software components
while keeping the license file and other files in <installation_directory>
which may have been created by you. It may also not reset its entry in the
INTEL_LICENSE_FILE environment variable.

The Intel Trace Analyzer and Collector software and licenses can coexist with
previous versions.

------------------
Known Limitations:
------------------

The Intel Trace Analyzer may get into an undefined state if too many files
are opened at the same time. 

Certain versions of ld (for example the ones distributed with Red Hat Enterprise
Linux* 3 and 4) have problems linking with the Intel Trace Collector shared
libraries. As a workaround you can use the static libraries or specify the
following options to ld: "-Wl,--allow-shlib-undefined -Wl,--noinhibit-exec"
which will result in a correct binary.

In some cases symbols information may appear incorrectly in the Intel Trace
Analyzer if you discarded symbols information from object files.

MPI Correctness Checking is available for the Intel(R) MPI Library only.

Binary instrumentation (itcpin) is not supported on SGI MPT*.

The Intel Trace Collector for Microsoft* Windows* CCS OS has the following
limitations compared to Version for Linux* OS:
- no distributed memory checking
- itcpin is not supported if the "McAfee Host Intrusion Prevention"* antivirus
  software is active

Please read the Reference Guides for details.
