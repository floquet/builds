The new (as of October 2000) web address is
http://www.astro.caltech.edu/~tjp/pgplot/
and the ftp address for downloading PGPLOT is
ftp://ftp.astro.caltech.edu/pub/pgplot/pgplot5.2.tar.gz

Use the convention that everything important can be found at
the top level and that the source is renamed "src".

For my testing
export PGPLOT_DIR=/work/scheinin/pgplot
whereas for actual installation
export PGPLOT_DIR=/usr/local/usp/pgplot

cp pgplot5.2.tar.gz $PGPLOT_DIR
cd $PGPLOT_DIR
tar xvzf pgplot5.2.tar.gz
mv pgplot src
cd src

Edit drivers.list
There is a drivers.list from the previous installation.
For the installation on sapphire I added some more drivers,
those which I had included in my previous installations of pgplot.
In particular, Portable Network Graphics and Portable Pixel Map
because these are very convenient for further manipulation.

previously the procedure was
ln -s `which g77`  g77_gcc_aout
but g77 no longer exists
there is a choice as to the Fortran version
The Linux distribution as /usr/bin/gfortran version 4.1.2
whereas doing
module swap PrgEnv-pgi PrgEnv-gnu
puts /opt/gcc/4.3.2/bin/gfortran first in the PATH,
which is version 4.3.2
I chose version 4.3.2 based on the idea that the PrgEnv-gnu is
formally the Gnu compilers for the machine whereas /usr/bin/gfortran
just happened to be installed when the operating system was installed.

module swap PrgEnv-pgi PrgEnv-gnu

src/makefile has line

I checked, all these are in /usr/include ,
so commented-out that line.

*** Finished compilation of PGPLOT ***
 
Note that if you plan to install PGPLOT in a different
directory than the current one, the following files will be
needed.
 
       libpgplot.a
       grfont.dat
       rgb.txt
       pgxwin_server
 
Also note that subsequent usage of PGPLOT programs requires that
the full path of the chosen installation directory be named in
an environment variable named PGPLOT_DIR.

make cpg
 
*** Finished compilation of the C PGPLOT wrapper library ***
 
Note that if you plan to install the library in a different
directory than the current one, both libcpgplot.a and cpgplot.h
will be needed.

My previous notes included the copying of *.so but indeed this
installation does not produce that kind of library.

When finally installed
cp grfont.dat *.a *.h pgxwin_server rgb.txt /usr/local/usp/pgplot/

For my test build
cp grfont.dat *.a *.h pgxwin_server rgb.txt ..

changed first line giving perl location in files
