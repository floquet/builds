>Both concepts use the same filter grammar in their filter expressions.
See <A
HREF="c2028.html#FLTRDLG"
>Section 5.1</A
> and <A
HREF="x2253.html"
>Section 5.2</A
> for usage
hints.</P
><P
>Conceptually there is a different filter for each class of
events: function events, messages and collective operations. During
analysis the right filter expression is evaluated for each event and
the event is tagged or passed on, if the expression is true while it
is left untagged or suppressed, if the expression is false.</P
><P
>The behavior of a filter is determined at the time of its
creation. A filter will continue filtering the same way until it
is changed, even if the thread groups or function groups that it
references are changed. Events will be treated as belonging to
these groups based on the state of the groups at the time the
filter was first created.</P

>If several events are merged as described in <A
HREF="c3010.html#LOD"
>Section 10.1</A
> then the merged event is tagged if at least one of the
singular events is tagged.</P
><P
>Therefore tagging in particular together with the Qualitative Timeline
Chart (see <A
HREF="x1003.html"
>Section 4.2</A
>) is a very powerful tool
to find events matching a certain criterion. This is because only if a
single event out of billions matches the criteria of the tag filter,
then it is guaranteed that there will be a highlighted peak in the Qualitative
Timeline Chart that indicates where to zoom into the trace.</P

>If an event is suppressed by filtering then the effect is as if
it were never written to the trace file. This is relatively easy to
understand for messages and collective operations. </P
><P
>However, if a filter is designed that lets all functions except
MPI pass, then there won't be holes in the Event Timeline, instead it will look as if MPI was not called. This means that it will look as if the
thread was in the calling function instead of being in MPI. The same is true 
for the call tree and the call graph.</P
><P
>What happens if there are functions A, B and C in the trace where
A calls B and B calls C and then suppress B by filtering it out? It
would appear as if A had called C directly! This is quite different from
choosing a function aggregation that does not cover B, because that
will show the function group <SPAN
CLASS="emphasis"
><I
CLASS="emphasis"
>other</I
></SPAN
> wherever
B was shown before. Again: Filtering and Aggregation are orthogonal.
