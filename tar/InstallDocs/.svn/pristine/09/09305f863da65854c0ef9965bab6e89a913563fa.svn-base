The download page says that you will get files with names
OpenFOAM-4.x-version-4.1 and ThirdParty-version-4.1
but that is not true.  The download is named version-4.1
The following procedure works

export BUILD_DIR=/p/home/scheinin/build/openfoam_sgimpt

mkdir $BUILD_DIR
cd $BUILD_DIR

wget http://dl.openfoam.org/source/4-1
tar xzf version-4.1
mv version-4.1  OpenFOAM-version-4.1
mv OpenFOAM-4.x-version-4.1  OpenFOAM-4.1

wget http://dl.openfoam.org/third-party/4-1
tar xzf version-4.1
mv version-4.1 ThirdParty-version-4.1
mv ThirdParty-4.x-version-4.1 ThirdParty-4.1

add rpath-link of WM_LDFLAGS, because WM_LDFLAGS does not seem

cd ThirdParty-4.1/

Make sure scotch has been built.

# Need to test parallel version

# WM_PROJECT_USER_DIR is set in
${BUILD_DIR}/OpenFOAM-4.1/etc/cshrc
${BUILD_DIR}/OpenFOAM-4.1/etc/bashrc

We see that ${BUILD_DIR}/OpenFOAM-4.1/etc/bashrc sources many files
> grep config ${BUILD_DIR}/OpenFOAM-4.1/etc/bashrc
. $WM_PROJECT_DIR/etc/config.sh/functions
_foamSource $WM_PROJECT_DIR/etc/config.sh/settings
_foamSource $WM_PROJECT_DIR/etc/config.sh/aliases
_foamSource `$WM_PROJECT_DIR/bin/foamEtcFile config.sh/mpi`
_foamSource `$WM_PROJECT_DIR/bin/foamEtcFile config.sh/paraview`
_foamSource `$WM_PROJECT_DIR/bin/foamEtcFile config.sh/ensight`
_foamSource `$WM_PROJECT_DIR/bin/foamEtcFile config.sh/gperftools`
    _foamSource `$WM_PROJECT_DIR/bin/foamEtcFile config.sh/CGAL`
. $WM_PROJECT_DIR/etc/config.sh/functions

so the affect of sourcing bashrc can depend on configuration
information in many other files.

Another way to view dependencies is the following command
> grep WM_PROJECT_DIR ${BUILD_DIR}/OpenFOAM-4.1/etc/bashrc
foamOldDirs="$WM_PROJECT_DIR $WM_THIRD_PARTY_DIR \
export WM_PROJECT_DIR=$WM_PROJECT_INST_DIR/$WM_PROJECT-$WM_PROJECT_VERSION
. $WM_PROJECT_DIR/etc/config.sh/functions
_foamSource `$WM_PROJECT_DIR/bin/foamEtcFile prefs.sh`
foamClean=$WM_PROJECT_DIR/bin/foamCleanPath
_foamSource $WM_PROJECT_DIR/etc/config.sh/settings
_foamSource $WM_PROJECT_DIR/etc/config.sh/aliases
_foamSource `$WM_PROJECT_DIR/bin/foamEtcFile config.sh/mpi`
_foamSource `$WM_PROJECT_DIR/bin/foamEtcFile config.sh/paraview`
_foamSource `$WM_PROJECT_DIR/bin/foamEtcFile config.sh/ensight`
_foamSource `$WM_PROJECT_DIR/bin/foamEtcFile config.sh/gperftools`
    _foamSource `$WM_PROJECT_DIR/bin/foamEtcFile config.sh/CGAL`
. $WM_PROJECT_DIR/etc/config.sh/functions

> grep WM_PROJECT_USER_DIR ${BUILD_DIR}/OpenFOAM-4.1/etc/bashrc
export WM_PROJECT_USER_DIR=$HOME/$WM_PROJECT/$USER-$WM_PROJECT_VERSION

Try changing ${BUILD_DIR}/OpenFOAM-4.1/etc/bashrc , so that
export WM_PROJECT_USER_DIR=$WORKDIR/$WM_PROJECT/$USER-$WM_PROJECT_VERSION
Notice, $WORKDIR instead of $HOME .

source etc/bashrc
mkdir $WM_PROJECT_USER_DIR
mkdir $WM_PROJECT_USER_DIR/run

ls $FOAM_TUTORIALS
cd $FOAM_RUN
cp -R $FOAM_TUTORIALS .

See

for running tests.

change mpirun to mpiexec_mpt

    The simplest way to run a tutorial in OpenFOAM is to run blockMesh followed by the name of the solver, such as icoFoam. To know the name of the solver in question, have a look into the file system/controlDict and see the name defined for the keyword application.
    But the situation changes when the case is more complicated. In those cases, there are a couple of helper scripts inside the case folder or inside the parent folder of that case, named Allrun and Allclean. To run them, simply prepend ./ to the script's name, e.g.:

    ./Allrun

    Some examples of tutorials that have these scripts:
        In OpenFOAM 2.1, the tutorial incompressible/simpleFoam/motorBike has got the Allrun script.
        Also in OpenFOAM 2.1, the tutorial incompressible/icoFoam/cavity does not have the Allrun script, but the parent folder incompressible/icoFoam does have that script. This means that this Allrun script will run all tutorials within the folder incompressible/icoFoam.

E.g.
cd /p/work2/scheinin/OpenFOAM/scheinin-4.1/run/tutorials/mesh/foamyHexMesh
./Allrun
Running foamyHexMesh in parallel on /p/work2/scheinin/OpenFOAM/scheinin-4.1/run/tutorials/mesh/foamyHexMesh/mixerVessel using 8  processes
and much more
One error
Running reconstructParMesh on /p/work2/scheinin/OpenFOAM/scheinin-4.1/run/tutorials/mesh/foamyHexMesh/mixerVessel
cp: cannot stat `/polyMesh': No such file or directory
Difficult to determine where it failed.

No summary to say if overall it failed or succeeded.
