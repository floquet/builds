Function Profile shows either a pair of mapped names formatted as

column of the profile flags which functions are present in which
trace. The other columns indicate for which of the traces there was
valid data. When there is only valid data from one file, no
meaningful comparison can be done.</P
><P
>Even for a function <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"F"</SPAN
> that is present in both
traces the currently selected time intervals (or aggregations, or
filters) can have the effect that there is no data from one of the
traces. In this case the first column would carry the label
<SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"F"</SPAN
> since the mapping is ok but the other columns would
have <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"

>If you choose <SPAN

CLASS="QUOTE"

then all fields will show remarks indicating that no comparison could
be made because of lacking data - at least as long as the current
comparison operation needs data from A and B. If you switch to a
comparison operation of <SPAN
CLASS="emphasis"
><I
CLASS="emphasis"
>A</I
></SPAN
> or
<SPAN
CLASS="emphasis"
><I
CLASS="emphasis"
>B</I

even when the function aggregations do not fit.  <A
HREF="x2820.html#COMP.FUNCPROFMISMATCH"
>Figure 7-6</A
> shows such a case: there is data for
run A and B but in the rightmost profile there is nothing to calculate
the comparison operation B/A on.</P
><P
>The horizontal bars in the graphical columns work similar to the
regular Function Profile except when the comparison operation is set
to <SPAN
CLASS="emphasis"
><I
CLASS="emphasis"
>A/B</I
></SPAN
> or <SPAN
CLASS="emphasis"
><I
CLASS="emphasis"
>B/A</I
></SPAN
>. In this case
the length of the bars is proportional to the logarithm of the given
value. A value of for example 1/5 results in a bar from the middle to
the left, while a value of 5 results in a bar of the same length but
from the middle to the right. So switching between
<SPAN
CLASS="emphasis"
><I
CLASS="emphasis"
>A/B</I
></SPAN
> and <SPAN
CLASS="emphasis"
><I
CLASS="emphasis"
>B/A</I
></SPAN
> will mirror the
bars around the middle. Please note that the full column width shows
at least the range from 1/2 to 2 so that factors near to 1 do not
generate big bars that would invite to misinterpret them as very big
changes between the two runs.</P

>&#13;The context menu of the Comparison Function Profile is pretty much the

comparison operation. See below.</P

the one for the regular Function Profile (refer to <A

the comparison operation.</P

>The values shown in the cells are calculated using the currently
selected comparison operation shown in the title of the Chart. The
comparison operation can be switched from the context menu or from the
settings dialog. If the comparison operation makes use of A and B and
only one of the values is present for a given cell, then this cell is
labeled with <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"A"</SPAN
> or <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"B"</SPAN
> indicating for which
trace data is present. If there is no data at all the cell is left
empty.</P
><P
>Some groupings are dependent on the mapping rules in that they
either use processes, process groups or communicators as row or column
labels. If differing labels are mapped onto the same column or row
then the label is made up of two lines with the first line holding the
label for file A and the second for file B. This can happen for the
groupings Sender, Receiver, Sender/Receiver and Communicator. In <A
HREF="x2820.html#COMP.MSGPROF"
>Figure 7-8</A
> the process aggregation is
<SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"All_Processes"</SPAN
> for one file and <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"All_Nodes"</SPAN
>
for the other which results in double line labels in the
profile.</P
><P
>There can be cases where a whole row or column does not apply to
one of the traces. In these cases the double line label holds <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"A
missing"</SPAN
> or <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"B missing"</SPAN
>. This can happen for the
groupings Sender, Receiver and Sender/Receiver that may have
unmappable TGroups in the labels or for groupings like Tag,
Communicator or Volume that directly depend on the data that is
present in the trace. The Settings Dialog box of the Comparison
Message Profile has means to suppress such rows and columns, but they
are shown by default.</P
