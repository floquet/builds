Users of VASP need to be in the group "vasp".

The wrappers for running vasp are in the directory
/usr/local/applic/vasp/4.6.36/bin

There are five variants:

runvasp          Serial execution
runvasp-gamma    Serial execution with gamma (may run faster)

runvasp-mpi-gamma        Parallel execution with scalapack and gamma.
runvasp-mpi-scalapack    Parallel execution with scalapack
runvasp-mpi-large        Same as runvasp-mpi-scalapack but with
                         NIOND set to 1024 rather than the default 256.

The default parallel version does not use gamma, it actually runs
runvasp-mpi-scalapack and is called:
runvasp-mpi

These scripts take one argument, the number of processors.

The scripts were compiled with the modules
compilers/intel11.1   mpi/sgi_mpi-1.26   compilers/mkl_10.2.0
The Scalapack versions use the library in /usr/local/usp/scalapack .
The serial versions use
/usr/local/usp/PETtools/CE/pkgs/fftw-3.2.2
