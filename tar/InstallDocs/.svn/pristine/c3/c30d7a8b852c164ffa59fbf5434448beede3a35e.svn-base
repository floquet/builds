Subject: link to discussion of "NIOND too small in VASP" warning

Hi David,

Here is the link to the discussion a the vasp support site:

http://cms.mpi.univie.ac.at/vasp-forum/forum_viewtopic.php?3.2081

The "head admin" writes:

NIOND is set to 256 (as a parameter) in dyna.F. Please increase this number (PARAMETER (NIOND=256) ) and recompile vasp

Could you please increase NIOND to 1024?  I'll definitely run jobs with 860 ions,
so that will give me a nice cushion just in case.

Thanks very much!
Steve
