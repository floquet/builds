Enrico,
   I went to the post office with your books.  The U.S. Post Office
does not now have a catergory "surface mail".  The lowest cost
option was an "M-Bag".  As they were packing up the bag I heard
the person say that it was for books.  Actually, I did add one DVD
as a present, I hope that will not cause a problem.  Also, I hope
it will play in a different zone.  Since you were once interested in
economics, the DVD is from a public television show about economics.
   The receipt says "Italy - Air Mail M-Bag".  Though it says air mail,
it was the lowest cost option.  The cost was 100 dollars (and 75 cents).
It weighed 31 pounds.
