Description:
Gaussian used for calculating molecular electronic structure and properties. 
The package includes a wide range of ab initio and semi-empirical methods
for energy, gradient, frequency and property calculations.

This directory contains a small test case g09.pbs that you can copy
to your personal directory and submit as a batch job.  Be sure to
change the account (-A) option.

Gaussian is a restricted access application, contact the ERDC DSRC for access.

Your batch script is interpreted on a "batch" node that is shared by
many users, so be certain not to run the executable, g09, on the
"batch" node.  That is, do not use the command
g09 test.com  # Wrong

Using aprun will launch gaussian on a "compute" node but all threads will
use the same core, which is very inefficient.  So, do not use the command
aprun -n 1 g09 test.com  # Wrong

The correct way to run Gaussian is to use the Cluster Compatible Mode
(CCM) which is started by using the PBS option " -l ccm=1 ".
The job should be launched using the command

ccmrun g09 test.com # Correct

Notice that in order to use more than one node, the nodes listed in
$PBS_NODEFILE must be added as a line in your Gaussian command file.
The script g09.pbs shows how to do that.

Note that the example is taken from
 $g09root/g09/tests/com/test397.com
and shows %mem=16MW
For actual calculations this value can be much higher.  It is the
amount of memory on one node, which is a maximum of %mem=60GB per
node (of memory available for user processes) on Garnet.
