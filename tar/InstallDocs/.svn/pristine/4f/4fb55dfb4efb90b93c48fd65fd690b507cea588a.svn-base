On jade, compiled with Gnu, so use Gnu compiler on diamond.

Got subversion-1.6.6.tar.gz and subversion-deps-1.6.6.tar.gz

Already have on diamond
   Zlib  (REQUIRED)
   autoconf 2.59 or newer (Unix only)
   libtool 1.4 or newer (Unix only)
   OpenSSL  (OPTIONAL)
   Berkeley DB 4.X  (OPTIONAL)
      /usr/include/db4/db.h
   Cyrus SASL library (OPTIONAL)
   Python 2.4 or newer (http://www.python.org/)  (OPTIONAL)
   Perl 5.8 or newer (Windows only)  (OPTIONAL)
   SQLite  (REQUIRED)
      /usr/lib64/libsqlite3.so.0.8.6
      devel package not installed
   pkg-config  (Unix only, OPTIONAL)
      /usr/bin/pkg-config
   D-Bus  (Unix only, OPTIONAL)
   Qt 4  (Unix only, OPTIONAL)
      Have qt-4.3.4-0.3 and dbus-1-qt-4.3.4-0.3 but might
      not have necessary devel files.  Only needed for KWallet.
   GLib 2  (Unix only, OPTIONAL)
      Have glib2-2.8.6-0.13 but not devel.

Use from deps
   Apache Portable Runtime 0.9.7 or 1.X.X  (REQUIRED)
      APR and APR-util
No
   Ctypesgen  (OPTIONAL)
      Not in /usr/lib64/python2.4 nor /usr/lib64/python2.4/site-packages
   An HTTP client libary:  serf.  (OPTIONAL)
      > If you want your client to be able to speak to an Apache
      > server (via a http:// or https:// URL), you must link against
      > serf.  Though optional, we strongly recommend this.
      But not installed, unlikely that an HTTP server will be used.

# Using "--with-ssl" results in neon error
# configure: error: could not find library containing RSA_new
# which stops the configuration process

# Note the following warnings
# configure: WARNING: no JNI header files found.
# configure: WARNING: python bindings cannot be built without distutils module

# Several parts used /usr/KRB5/lib that did not have shared libraries
# and did not have libraries compiled with -fPIC and as a consequence
# --enable-shared resulted in a failed make.
# Note that on jade there was
# /usr/local/krb5/openssl/lib
# but nothing similar exists on diamond on Jan. 2010

# Disable shared because
# /usr/KRB5/lib/libgssapi_krb5.a
# was not compiled with -fPIC

# The syntax --with-berkeley-db=db.h:/usr/include/db4:/usr/lib64:db
# is correct, I believe, yet the compilation line is -Idb.h which
# causes libtool warnings.

make
make check
First set of tests all succeeded 71/71,
but 25 tests "XFAILED" but I cannot see a specific reason why
make install
make clean
