It is important to have the module xt-libsci loaded in order
to use basic routines optimized (presumably) by Cray,
for example BLAS, BLACS and ScaLAPACK.
The xt-libsci is now loaded as default.

It is not enough to untar src.tar.gz.  It is also necessary
to have the directory Install which has configuration
files for various platforms.
Starting with directories src/ and include/ from src.tar.gz
and the directory Install/ (with Cray-related configurations
from the file Additions_for_XT3.tar) the commands

cd Install
./configure

results in the directories lib/ and
src_linux_xt3-mpi_mpich-kpts-nospin/
being created.

It must be noted that different users might want different
values for the model method, different from kpts and nospin.

First
mkdir ./lib/linux_pgroup
If the above directory already exists and has files from
a previous installation, make sure it has all the files
inside removed.  After build there should be a new
bin/tbmd_linux_xt3-mpi-mpich-kpts-nospin
and a new lib/linux_pgroup/libtime_linux_xt3.a

When running "configure" various questions are asked.
Compile for src_linux_xt3-mpi_mpich-kpts-nospin
Choose "libpath" rather than "fullpath".

When running "./configure" used the defaults, as shown below,
for gamma vs. kpts , spin vs nospin.  Notice that used "xt3"
instead of "pgroup" in order to have ftn as the compiler.

Gamma vs. mult. k-points: ( gamma | kpts ) [default=kpts] 
You chose: 'kpts'
Spin polarized calculations: ( spin | nospin ) [default=nospin] 
You chose: 'nospin'
System type: ( sgi | altix | alpha | linux | rs6000 ) [default=linux] 
You chose: 'linux'
  Compiler: ( absoft | xt3 | pgroup | absoft_lcs | intel | pathscale ) [default=pgroup] xt3
  You chose: 'xt3'
  BLAS library via -l or full path: ( fullpath | libpath ) [default=libpath] 
  You chose: 'libpath'
  LAPACK library via -l or full path: ( fullpath | libpath ) [default=libpath] 
  You chose: 'libpath'
  Version: ( serial | mpi ) [default=serial] mpi
  You chose: 'mpi'
    MPI Version: ( mpich | lam-mpi ) [default=mpich] mpich
    You chose: 'mpich'
    BLACS library via -l or full path: ( fullpath | libpath ) [default=libpath] 
    You chose: 'libpath'
    BLACSF77INIT library via -l or full path: ( fullpath | libpath ) [default=libpath] 
    You chose: 'libpath'
    SCALAPACK library via -l or full path: ( fullpath | libpath ) [default=libpath] 
    You chose: 'libpath'
linux_xt3-mpi_mpich-kpts-nospin
copying make_linux_xt3-mpi_mpich-kpts-nospin.inc ../src_linux_xt3-mpi_mpich-kpts-nospin/make.inc

Files in the directory bin/ from time when this was installed from
sapphire were copied to tbmd_jade-cnl2.2/bin because
it contains Perl scripts that do not in directory source.
After running make, one file is updated:
tbmd_linux_xt3-mpi-mpich-kpts-nospin

Now cd into src_linux_xt3-mpi_mpich-kpts-nospin and run make

After running "configure", look at make.inc in order to
check the configuration.
I don't understand why there is instruction "mkdir ./lib/linux_pgroup"
when the compilation is for "xt3" but in fact make.inc has
LIB             = $(TBMD)/lib/linux_pgroup/

Note that compiler choice is xt3 rather than pgroup in order
to have the Fortran compiler be "ftn".

cd src_linux_xt3-mpi_mpich-kpts-nospin
make

Result put into
lib/linux_pgroup//libtime_linux_xt3.a
bin/tbmd_linux_xt3-mpi-mpich-kpts-nospin

# Not in original instructions, but anyway it seems that
# this module is part of the default environment.
module load xt-libsci

first
mkdir ./lib/linux_pgroup
If the above directory already exists and has files from
a previous installation, make sure it has all the files
inside removed.  After build there should be a new
bin/tbmd_linux_xt3-mpi-mpich-kpts-nospin
and a new lib/linux_pgroup/libtime_linux_xt3.a

If copying from a previous installation, I suppose that
one should run "make clean"
in directory src_linux_xt3-mpi_mpich-kpts-nospin
before running Install/configure .

Installation:
    run "Install/configure"

compile for src_linux_xt3-mpi_mpich-kpts-nospin
    Answer questions

    Follow instructions, which are
> copying make_linux_xt3-mpi_mpich-kpts-nospin.inc
>         ../src_linux_xt3-mpi_mpich-kpts-nospin/make.inc
> Now cd into src_linux_xt3-mpi_mpich-kpts-nospin and run make

Look at make.inc in order to check configuration
I don't understand why there is instruction "mkdir ./lib/linux_pgroup"
when the compilation is for "xt3" but in fact make.inc has
LIB             = $(TBMD)/lib/linux_pgroup/

Note that compiler choice is xt3 rather than pgroup in order
to have the Fortran compiler be "ftn".

The questions to answer include the location of BLACS,
BLACSF77INIT and SCALAPACK; so it is necessary to be
certain that module xt-libsci is in "module list".
Chose "libpath" rather than fullpath.
