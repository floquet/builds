The graphics plotting application Grace has been built for both
the Intel and the Gnu compilers.

The built software can be found in

Intel compiler:
/usr/local/usp/Grace/5.1.22-intel/grace

Gnu compiler:
/usr/local/usp/Grace/5.1.22-gnu/grace

In order to be generally useful, Grace has been compiled with the
ability to read NetCDF files.  The NetCDF software requires several
other dynamic libraries, so the user will need to set the LD_LIBRARY_PATH,
as shown below.

Intel compiler:
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/usp/szip/2.1-intel/lib:/usr/local/usp/hdf5/1.8.4-serial-intel/lib:/usr/local/usp/netcdf/netcdf-4.0.1-serial-intel/lib:/usr/local/usp/fftw-2.1.5/lib:/opt/intel/Compiler/11.1/056/lib/intel64:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH

Gnu compiler:
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/usp/szip/2.1-gnu/lib:/usr/local/usp/hdf5/1.8.4-gnu/lib:/usr/local/usp/netcdf/netcdf-4.0.1-gnu/lib:/usr/local/usp/fftw-2.1.5/lib:/usr/lib64:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
