For /usr/local/usr/gmt/4.4.0/src the tar source files *.bz2
were taken from the previous installation.
(moved /usr/local/usp/gmt/4.4.0 to
/usr/local/usp/gmt/4.4.0.old
then copied /usr/local/usp/gmt/4.4.0.old/src/*
to /usr/local/usp/gmt/4.4.0/src/)
It is important at all the ftp options are set to "n" in the
file GMTparam.txt so that the tar source files are not
overwritten with a more recent version.  The previous
installation was renamed /usr/local/usr/gmt/4.4.0.old and
all the files (but not the GMT4.4.0 directory were copied
to /usr/local/usr/gmt/4.4.0 .  As well as setting ftp to "n",
the installation location of NetCDF was changed in
GMTparam.txt to be
netcdf_path=/usr/local/usp/netcdf/netcdf-4.0.1-gnu

# make sure GMT_flock=n in GMTparam.txt

# In /usr/local/usr/gmt/4.4.0/src build was done using
# the command
sh install_gmt GMTparam.txt >install.out

For installation of 4.5.1, the directories 
/usr/local/usp/gmt/4.5.1
was created as the destination
(subdirectories bin  include  lib  man  share)
and /usr/local/usp/gmt/4.5.1/src was used as
a repository of the source.

Initially, only install_gmt was downloaded using
wget ftp://ftp.soest.hawaii.edu/gmt/install_gmt
and it was run interactively, using the web page
GMT Installation Helper as a guide.
(Near the bottom of the page is advice concerning the options.)
Specifically, the commands were

 wget ftp://ftp.soest.hawaii.edu/gmt/install_gmt
 chmod ug+x install_gmt
./install_gmt

The initial installation did not go well, but that is not a problem.
Subsequent installation attempts used the non-interactive usage

sh install_gmt GMTparam.txt >install.out

after changing GMTparam.txt as needed to overcome problems.

For any new version, one important change is to set
GMT_prefix=/usr/local/usp/gmt/<version>
in the file GMTparam.txt .
Also, for a new GMTparam.txt the location of NETCDF needs
to be set, e.g.
netcdf_path=/usr/local/usp/netcdf/netcdf-4.0.1-gnu

To repeat what is written above, if it is being recompiled
because the O/S has changed substantially, but the GMT
version is not the most recent, then set GMT_ftp=n
and GMT_get_*=n in order to preserve the *.bz2 files.
Also, rather important, if no ftp is done then no bunzip2 is done.
If the *.bz2 files are already in src/ and you do not want
to download them again because they would be overwritten
by the wrong version, the the installer needs to do by hand
 bbb=`/bin/ls *.bz2`
 for i in $bbb ; do tar xvjf $i; done

Though the *.bz2 files do not show a version number, the
extraction writes to a subdirectory GMT<version>

After installing 4.5.1 there was the following message
that I put into the README_gmt file

For csh or tcsh users:
setenv NETCDFHOME /usr/local/usp/netcdf/netcdf-4.0.1-gnu
set path=(/usr/local/usp/gmt/4.5.1/bin $path)

For sh or bash users:
export NETCDFHOME=/usr/local/usp/netcdf/netcdf-4.0.1-gnu
export PATH=/usr/local/usp/gmt/4.5.1/bin:$PATH

For all users:
Add /usr/local/usp/gmt/4.5.1/man to MANPATH
Add /usr/local/usp/gmt/4.5.1/share/html/gmt_services.html as browser bookmark

In addition, though the libraries are static, the installation
did not run to completion until I did

export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/usp/hdf5/1.8.4-gnu/lib:/usr/local/usp/netcdf/netcdf-4.0.1-gnu/lib:/usr/local/usp/szip/2.1-gnu/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH

The LD_LIBRARY_PATH might have been needed for testing done automatically.

I also write in README_gmt about the need to add library directories
to LD_LIBRARY_PATH.
