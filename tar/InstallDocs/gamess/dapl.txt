The following error may occur on rare occasions with IntelMPI/
uDAPL:
"unexpected DAPL event 4008 from ..."
This problem is caused by a limitation in Intel MPI/uDAPL's
dynamic connection mechanism when MPI processes are not
sufficiently attentive to incoming interconnect traffic.
To work around this, add the following to your mpirun
command:
genv I_MPI_USE_DYNAMIC_CONNECTIONS 0
QLogic
