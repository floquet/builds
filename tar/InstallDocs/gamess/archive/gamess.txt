There is an optional QM/MM add-on module available for GAMESS, based on the Tinker program. Because this code has a different memory management style, and other differences to the GAMESS coding style, it is not included with the standard distribution. If you are interested in this, and have already completed the downloading process of GAMESS itself, as described above, you can download the additional source code for Tinker. 

Alan,
Please continue building usp software and I'll help you put in place when I get back. I have put GAMESS in your workdir -- both a copy from jade and the original source. Tinker is a small replacement of a file that results in a different binary.
