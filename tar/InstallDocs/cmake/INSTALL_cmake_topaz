One Feb. 1, 2017
Had error /usr/include/c++/4.3/ext/new_allocator.h(114): error: a value of type "int" cannot be used to initialize an entity of type "const char *"
  	{ ::new((void *)__p) _Tp(std::forward<_Args>(__args)...); }
  	                         ^
failed during configure.
The Gnu compiler worked.  Made one change
 export CXXFLAGS="-fPIC -std=c++11"
in case it was a new C++ construct,
but that did not solve the problem.
Configured with
export PREFIX=/apps/unsupported/cmake/3.7.2-intel-17.0.1
and
module swap compiler/intel/15.0.3 compiler/intel/17.0.1
Did the following also,
export PATH=/apps/gnu_compiler/6.1.0/bin:$PATH
and then compilation was successful.
The last step may have cause icpc to use g++6.1.0 syntax.
