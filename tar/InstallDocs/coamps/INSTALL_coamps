jade  coamps3.1.1

 module load xt-libsci/10.4.0

Many Makefile files (e.g. ocean/libsrc/Makefile) have lines such as

"alpha ibm sun linux_intel linux_pgi:"

so it is not possible to have a new type.

Need to comment-out original linux_pgi.

modified config.user

make linux_pgi 2>&1 | tee make.log

  ----------

atmos/config.atmos

linux_intel:
[...]
added:
	"EXTRALIBS= -lmpi"

make linux_intel 2>&1 | tee make.log

/work/scheinin/COAMPS/coamps4.2.2-release/atmos/libsrc/aalib/coama.F
has problems.
