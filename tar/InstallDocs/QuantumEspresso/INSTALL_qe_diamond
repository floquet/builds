Building Quantum Espresso on diamond without scalapack
using SGI MPI.  (Intel MPI was not tried.
Result using SGI MPI was not tested.)  -- Alan

Note that User Guide says that "configure" has the option
 --with-scalapack=intel use ScaLAPACK for Intel MPI (default:OpenMPI)
I must strongly emphasize that program was built with
SGI MPI, not Intel MPI, so it is no surprise that scalapack
was not included.

./configure  --with-scalapack=intel

It appears that the option 
 --prefix=/usr/local/u/scheinin/Espresso
has no meaning because there is no "make install" target.

After making many changes to the list of libraries
and doing many experiments -- the end result is shown above --
I was not able to get "configure" to accept scalapack.
  After configure, it shows
  BLAS_LIBS=-lmkl_intel_lp64  -lmkl_sequential -lmkl_core
  LAPACK_LIBS= -lmkl_intel_lp64  -lmkl_sequential -lmkl_core
and no SCALAPACK_LIBS defined.

make all
