Lapack from libsci (Cray) or MKL (SGI) was used.
The modules used during build are shown below.

# sapphire
module load xt-libsci/10.3.4
# > module list [partial list below]
# pgi/8.0.5 xt-libsci/10.3.4 xt-mpt/3.4.0 PrgEnv-pgi/2.1.56HDB

# jade
module load xt-libsci/10.4.0
# > module list [partial list below]
# pgi/9.0.4 xt-libsci/10.4.0 xt-mpt/3.5.0 PrgEnv-pgi/2.2.41A_PS05

# diamond
module load compilers/mkl_10.2.0
# > module list
# Currently Loaded Modulefiles:
#   1) compilers/intel11.1  2) mpi/sgi_mpi-1.26   3) compilers/mkl_10.2.0

The Cray library only has a static library, the libraries
on diamond include both a shared and a static library.
The extra libraries during build were
# sapphire
 -L/opt/xt-libsci/10.3.4/pgi/lib -lsci
# jade
 -L/opt/xt-libsci/10.4.0/pgi/lib -lsci
# diamond
 -L/opt/intel/mkl/10.2.0.013/lib/em64t \
    -lmkl_lapack -lmkl_sequential -lmkl_intel_lp64 -lmkl_core

The results of the tests provided in the distribution
were all successful except for one test on diamond.
